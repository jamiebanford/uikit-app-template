# UIKit App Template

A template Xcode project for starting a UIKit app without a storyboard.

## Getting started

The project expects an [Xcode configurations settings file](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/adding-a-build-configuration-file-to-your-project/) called `Project.xcconfig`. 

To run the project this file should contain both product bundle identifier and your development team identifier:

```
PRODUCT_BUNDLE_IDENTIFIER = some.bundle.id
DEVELOPMENT_TEAM = D3VT34M1D
```
